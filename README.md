# Photo storage application

I am writing a storage web application for a server in my home to backup photos and videos.  

The project will be written in C++ using the Crow web framework for the backend. I will hook it up to a simple MySQL database just to maintain user information and photo metadata.

## Goals for the project, in order of learning goals

* Learn some C++ through the Crow framework
* Learn a little SQL through a simple MySQL backend
* Learn data persistence and redundancy through some kind of drive configuration like RAID. Not specific to the application but to the computer I'm running the service on.
* Use a simple frontend framework for user interaction
